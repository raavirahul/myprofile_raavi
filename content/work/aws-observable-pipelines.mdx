# Cutting ETL failures by 63% with observability-first pipelines

**Problem.** Orgs ship fast, then drown in retries. We needed consistent contracts & line-of-sight.

**Approach.** Contracts (pydantic), data tests (dbt), idempotent tasks, DLQs, alerting, cost guards.

**Architecture.** [diagram]

**Outcome.** 63% fewer failures in 8 weeks; rebuild under 4h; S3 cost −18% via compaction + lifecycle.
